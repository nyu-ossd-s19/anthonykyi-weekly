title: Week 3
---


Due to my lack of experience in coding in javascript, i felt as if i hadn't really contributed much to the project.  
I wish we had 1 more week with the project so that the group could have created time in order to meet up face to face
so that we would have a better understanding of what was going to happen in the project.

If we met up, I believe I would of understood the objectives of the project better as well as understand
how to use API's and stuff.  It would have been cool to see what my project partners were doing and the logic behind it.

It would have been an amazing learning experience if we were had time to meet but due to the time constraints, we
were unable to meet but rather work remotely via email.

Since we had no clue on our abilities of our skills in coding, asking someone to do something online was a difficult task.

I wish we had time to work on the project together in class.
