LibGDX uses Apache License 2.0

The Apache License allows you to download and use the software for any purpose, whether it is commercial or for personal reasons. 
However, you must give credit where it is due.

If you do decide to use the software, then you must make it have an Apache license as well.

Troubles

Currently, I am having troubles setting everything up.  For some strange reason, my computer cannot find the Android SDK file.
I have contacted the people in charge in order to resolve this and hopefully there will be a solution to this issue.

However, besides that, I believe the documentation for the downloading the environment was very easy to understand.
It is very clear on what I needed to download in order to further continue into working with LibGDX.

Presentation by Mozilla

I thought the presentation by Christos was a good refresher on what we were doing in class.
I thought it was interesting how Mozilla focused more on the human experience rather than its profits which made me
question whether it was the reason why it was making profits....
