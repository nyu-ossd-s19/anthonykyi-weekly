I believe that projects for social good and humanitarian goals in mind CAN be beneficial for society.
But generally speaking, the cynic in me believes that they are very ineffective....

For example, there have been many projects, such as the Haitian Earthquake Relief in 2010, that was deemed very ineffective.

There are also many articles how humanitarian aid can be used for the wrong reasons.

Also, it makes the recipients of aid more dependent on the project, which may stunt their growth because the people
are looking for short term solution, rather than the long term solution, which may hinder future growth.

Lastly, since we are sometimes not the victims of the problem, the goals of the projects that we create may not be the optimal solution
for the victims.  Also, the goals for the victims may change as time elapses.

However, many good works have come to fruition as well due to the work of many humanitarian projects.
This leads me to believe that in order to find a good humanitarian project, it must be flexible and adaptable as quickly as possible.

Also, I believe that there some checks and balances are in place so no one individual can take advantage of the project.

I believe that these projects are easier to get involved with since projects are constantly looking for volunteers.
However, it may be difficult to find a person that are willing to stick through with the project because peoples value may change as
time goes on.

I would not want to work for a humanitarian project because it would be difficult to hold someone accountable for their mistake since
much of it is done as volunteer work.  Many people may do it just to build their resume or something, rather than look at the number
of people that the project can potentially help.


I would like to work on a project that I am passionate for.  If it involves humanitarian aid, then I would love to work for it.
However, I would have to be PASSIONATE for it so that I can stay focused on the goal and be more active within the community.
It also must be a problem that I have faced firsthand so that I could provide input on the solutions that the people are developing.

The project that I would like to work on is FreeCodeCamp.  Thus, I will do an evaluation on it.
