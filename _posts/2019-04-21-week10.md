I found Kevin Flemings talk to be very interesting.  It was interesting to see the change in culture regarding
open source.  In the beginning, many companies despised the idea of creating open source software.  However,
as time progressed, the companies idea towards open source flipped around completely.

I also found what he does on a daily basis was very interesting and how dependent many financial sectors were
on bloomberg. (Such as the time when it shut down).


Project
I don't think the challenge we developed for freecodecamp was a good idea.  Thus, we are discussing to change it.
As of the moment, i think we are going to reverse a queue.  Or go with my original idea of teaching a react hook.
