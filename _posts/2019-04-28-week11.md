This week, for my contributions, I updated the yaml code, debugged the solutions, and fixed some of the solutions.
It took a while, to complete but after 3 hours of debugging and rereading on Yaml, I was finally able to resolve it.

However, there are other problems that have to be solved and I believe my other teammates will work on them.
If not, I will work on them again.
